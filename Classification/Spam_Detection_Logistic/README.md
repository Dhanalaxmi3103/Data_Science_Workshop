# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a spam detection classifier using Logistic Regression. It classifies emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## 📌 Objective
To build a binary classifier that can distinguish spam emails from non-spam based on word patterns.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File**: `spam_email_dataset.csv`
- Contains labeled email data with features like word frequencies, capital letter usage, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, train_test_split, accuracy_score)
- Google Colab

## 📈 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Train-Test Split**
3. **Model Training with Logistic Regression**
4. **Prediction & Accuracy Evaluation**


## 📎 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Upload `spam_email_dataset.csv`.
3. Run all cells.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Try Naive Bayes or SVM for comparison.
- Add TF-IDF vectorization.
