# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on realistic e-commerce sales data. The goal is to identify key sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue patterns to drive business decisions.

## 📌 Objective

To explore and visualize sales data to gain insights into:
- Revenue trends over time
- Top-selling products and categories

- Contains fields such as:
  - `Order ID`
  - `Product`
  - `Category`
  - `Order Date`
  - `Quantity Ordered`
  - `Price Each`
  - `Sales`
  - `City`, `State`
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
## 📈 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed nulls and invalid entries
   - Converted data types (e.g., dates, prices)
