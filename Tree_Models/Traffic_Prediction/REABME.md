# 🚗 Traffic Volume Prediction using Decision Tree Regression

Predicting traffic volume using decision trees based on weather and time-based data.

## 📌 Objective
To model traffic volume using decision tree regression and understand the impact of features like temperature, time, and weather conditions.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File**: `TrafficVolumeData.csv.zip`
- Features include: `temp`, `weather_main`, `hour`, `traffic_volume`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (DecisionTreeRegressor)
- Google Colab

## 📈 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Handle missing/null values
3. Train Decision Tree Regressor
4. Evaluate using R² and RMSE

## 📎 How to Run
- Upload the CSV zip and extract inside Colab
- Run all code cells
- Visualize predictions vs actual traffic

## 📚 Improvements
- Try Random Forest or XGBoost for better accuracy
- Use time series analysis
